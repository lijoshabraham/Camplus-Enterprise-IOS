# Camplus-Enterprise-IOS
Enhanced User interface and user experience compared to Moodle.
This app enables students and professors to communicate with each other without a need for sharing their personal contact and sharing media/text to the whole class (Reference: Remind)
This app allows students to post queries related to any common question, not only the technology but also with respect to any prevalent topics in the college (For example: How do I load cash into my Lambton id for taking printouts?) which allows students from the same class or students from other classes to view the question and answer them which enables future students who have a similar question to view this so as to help them solve the problem quickly (Reference: StackOverflow / Quora)
This app also displays the Common feeds (Firebase which gives real-time updates) which are shown on the home page and a new feed is automatically notified via the app as push notification, this can also be turned off in the settings. (Reference: Moodle)
This app also allows students to get tokens for meeting an advisor from student council services which also updates the students about the estimated wait time and how many people are currently in the queue before him. (Reference: Q-Less)
The app would have a dedicated login for administrators to post important updates as a feed or get information about the student service tokens and login for professors to communicate information to their students and login for students as well.
Themes to choose from to enhance the UI look and feel.
